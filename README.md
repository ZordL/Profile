 # Hi there 👋
 
I am a developer with a keen interest in games. This includes designing systems, like Roblox system and in general just trying to make a great user experience in any Game.

* 🔭 Currently I'm working on Physics, a game that when I can find some time to work on development! It's a game whose goal is to be a puzzle. The idea came after I saw several games about the puzzle, then decided to make one, however, with different thematics than the puzzles already made. It's very early in development at the moment, as I strive to avoid the impulsive nature of Vanguard world and use every new thing that comes out (spoiler: you control the time).

* 💬 Like all good developers, I have some opinionated preferences about tools and systems. It turns out that anonymous functions should not be used everywhere!
