 ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
I am a developer with a keen interest in games. This includes designing systems, like Roblox system and in general just trying to make a great user experience in any Game.

###### + ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a game, when I can find some time to work on development! It's a game whose goal is to be a puzzle, the idea came after I saw several games about puzzle, then decided to make one however with different thematics than the puzzles already made. It's very early in development at the moment, as I strive to avoid the impulsive nature of the avant-garde world and use every new thing that comes out (spoiler: you control the time).
